    <p class="proposal-paragraph">My theme will dive into conservation, both environmental and animal conservation, and the way in which our efforts and impacts on them, shape the outcome of our lives, ecosystems, and the living and natural world around us. The ultimate "end goal" is to present a call to action to the audience and/or users, by using my personal experiences, journey, and stories to engage them and inspire them to take active actions in supporting this universal topic. In addition to pulling from personal experience and sources, I'd also like to use light research and real world examples, to give more context and depth to my topic and emphasize the zine's content all together. While my topic is more on the serious side, I want to utilize visually engaging and appealing graphics and artworks to balance this and inspire more hope to the audience, rather than make them feel "guilty" or "sad" for the future. I want people to go through an experience that both educates them and takes them through a reflective experience that will also show them how small actions can lead to big change as well. </p>
