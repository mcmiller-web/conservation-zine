    <h1>ORIGIN</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I’ve grown to see conservation as a commitment and advocation for preservation of the rhythmic nature of life around us, and the natural world they inhabit. It’s a growing an understanding of the rippling breathe our choices have on organic systems.</p>

    <h1>THE FIRST ECHO</h1>
    <p>In the beginning, I understood conservation to be more as an abstract feeling or idea rather than a mindset in practice. It wasn’t until my first-hand experiences at the Oregon Zoo, that my admiration for animals and conservation itself took on a personal meaning. That experience sparked a growing desire to share my passion for animals and the diverse ecosystems they represent with anyone I could reach.</p>
